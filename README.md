# Student Performance Analysis

This project explores the factors influencing academic success through exploratory data analysis (EDA), leveraging data manipulation and visualization to uncover what truly affect students' final grades.

## Overview
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed a student performance dataset using Pandas for data manipulation and handling missing values.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined relationships between study time, attendance, parental education to understand their impact on the final grade.
* **Visualization:** Visualized key trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib then translating results into plain-language insights.

## Key Objectives
* Identify factors most correlated with final grades.
* Examine the impact of absences, study time, and parental education.
* Evaluate the predictive strength of early-term grades.

## Key Findings
* G2 is the strongest predictor of G3.
* Study time has a mild positive impact.
* Absences show very weak correlation after removing outliers.
* Past failures have a significant negative correlation on G3.
* Parental education may have a moderate influence.

## Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
